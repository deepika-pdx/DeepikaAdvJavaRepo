Assignment Name: CS510 Advance Java Project 3
Name: Deepika Parshvanath Velapure

Overview:
This is an 'Airline' project. It accepts details about an airline and its flight from the user via the command line and creates airline and flight objects.
An Airline has a unique name and can have multiple flights. Each flight has a unique identifying number, and it departs from a source location at a
given departure time, and arrives at a destination location at a given arrival time.

To run the project type the following in the command line:
java -jar target/airline-2023.0.0.jar [options] <args>
The arguments and the order in which they should be passed are as below:
args are (in this order):
    airline           The name of the airline
    flightNumber      The flight number
    source            Three-letter code of the departure airport
    departure date    Departure date in mm/dd/yyyy format
    departure time    Departure time in 12-hour time format
    departure period  Departure time period i.e. AM/am or PM/pm
    destination       Three-letter code of the arrival airport
    arrival date      Arrival date in mm/dd/yyyy format
    arrival time      Arrival time in 12-hour time format
    arrival period    Arrival time period i.e. AM/am or PM/pm
options are (options may appear in any order):
    -pretty file      Pretty print the airlineâ€™s flights to a text file or standard out. Provide this option as '-pretty file' or '-pretty -'
    -textFile file    File to read/write the airline info
    -print            Prints the description of the newly added flight
    -README           Prints a README for this project and exits

In case no options are provided : If no optional arguments are provided the project creates an airline and flight information using the data provided in the command line.

Behavior of the '-print' option: The '-print' optional parameter provides the flight details such as flight number, source location, departure date and time,
                                 destination location and arrival date and time.

Behavior of the '-textFile' option: The '-textFile' option allows a user to store the information about an airline and its flights.
                                    There are no restrictions on the filename. Also, the file path provided can be an absolute or relative path
                                    or it can even be the current directory. If the file provided with the '-textFile' does not exist, then a
                                    new file is created to store the airline and flight information passed through the arguments.
                                    If the file provided with the '-textFile' does exist, then the airline and flight information is read
                                    from that file and a new flight created using the command line arguments is written back to the file.
                                    The text in the file is formatted in a particular manner and the project does throw exceptions
                                    if a malformed file is provided in the input command line arguments.

Behavior of the '-pretty' option:   The '-pretty' option prints the information about an airline and its flights in an user-understandable simple
                                    text format. It accepts either a file name with path to which the airline and flight data can be pretty printed or a '-' symbol which indicates that the airline and flight data will be printed to the
                                    standard output terminal'. There are no restrictions on the filename. Also, the file path provided can be an
                                    absolute or relative path or it can even be the current directory. If the file provided with the '-pretty' does not
                                    exist, then a new file is created to pretty print the airline and flight information passed through the arguments.
                                    If the file provided with the '-textFile' does exist, then it is overwritten with the airline and flight
                                    information. If '-textFile' option is provided along with it, then the flights read from the text file
                                    provided with the '-textFile' option along with the new flight details provided in the command line are pretty printed.
